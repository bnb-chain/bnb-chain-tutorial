# Using Black IDE to Deploy NFTs on BSC

In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to the readers on how to issue Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (ERC721/1155) on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet using the Black IDE. This is a detailed guide to learning how to issue, mint and transfer NFTs on the BSC Testnet. The technology stack used in this tutorial includes Solidity , Truffle, MetaMask, and BlackIDE. 

## Learning Takeaways:
This tutorial will help you gain knowledge on the following learning points:
-	Using BlackIDE for smart contract development;
-	Managing Keypairs and Funding BNB Tokens to your account on BlackIDE;
-	MetaMask Wallet connectivity to BSC Testnet;
-	Smart-contract development;
-	Issuing, minting, and transferring NFTs;

## Technology Stack Details
-	BlackIDE v0.15.4
-	Truffle v5.5.19 (core: 5.5.19)
-	MetaMask Wallet v10.16.1
-	Docker v20.10.14

## Brief Introduction Tech Stack
1.	**Solidity:** one of the most popular object-oriented high-level smart contract programming languages. For more details on Solidity, refer here.
2.	**MetaMask Wallet Browser Extension:** we recommend using the Metamask Chrome extension. It is a web wallet that allows connecting the chrome browser to any valid blockchain network.
3.	**Black IDE:** Black IDE is an integrated development environment (IDE), making developing EVM-compatible smart contracts faster and easier. Black IDE offers both desktop and web (Black IDE Web) applications.

## Setting up the Environment
We aim to keep this tutorial as simple as possible and hence tend to use as minimal resources as possible and have used the following tools in this tutorial.
*	Metamask Wallet
*	Ensure that you have the Metamask Wallet extension installed and running on our browser.
*	Configure the Metamask wallet for use with the BSC Testnet. Use the following details to add the BSC Testnet. For further details, refer here.
*	Network Name: BSC Testnet
*	RPC URL: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/
*	Chain ID: 97
*	Currency Symbol: BNB
*	Block Explorer URL: https://testnet.bscscan.com 
*	Black IDE: both desktop app and web app are available and it is up to your convenience to choose from. For this tutorial, we used the desktop app as the web app lacks support for importing OpenZeppelin Contracts. 
*	Download/Install any dependencies required by BlackIDE

Upon successful build, the project navigation pane reflects a new folder named build. This folder contains contracts folder that has json files of the contracts built. All of the contracts imported in our BSCNFT contract are also built and imported as json files. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93580180/177948331-ece850ae-01fd-479b-b25f-d1f28c3400f6.png)

3.	After successfully building your contract, it’s time to deploy the contract. Click on the Deploy icon ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93580180/177944540-10d86198-03f2-40d8-8ac0-c013483c6458.png) for deploying your smart contract. Specify the details for your contract, as shown below, then click on the Estimate & Deploy button. The wizard will auto-estimate and fill the gas limit for your contract. Then click the Deploy button.

## Interact with deployed smart contract and Mint NFTs
1.	You can also interact with the contract using the different functions. Click on the Transactions Icon on the bottom-left corner of the IDE and then transaction of deployment of your smart contract. On the transaction details, click on the contract address to access the functions to interact with the smart contract. The left most column has all the Write Functions. The middle column has the View Functions and the right most column has the Events details.

## Mint NFTs
1.	As per our smart contract, when the contract is deployed, unless the NFTs are minted they won’t be visible in the wallet. 
2.	Create another keypair as defined previously. We will be issuing i.e. minting NFTs to the public address of this new keypair.
3.	To mint i.e. issue an NFT to a specific user we use the “safeMint” function of the deployed smart contract. As shown in Steps 1 and 2 in the figure below, navigate to the deployed contracts, then in the left-most column click the drop-down menu to view the list of write functions available for use with the deployed contract. Select the “safeMint” function. 
4.	Use the safeMint function to mint new NFTs to a specific user address. As shown in figure above, steps 3 to 6, enter the “ETH to send” as the minting price of NFT, as per our smart contract the minting price is 50000000000000000 Wei, i.e., 0.05 ETH. We entered 0.06 ETH to cover the transaction charges as well. Then select the address to whom you want to issue (mint) an NFT to. Here, for the To address use the newly generated keypair in the section above. After this, click the transact button  to execute the safeMint function. For the Signer, ensure that you are using the account that was used to deploy the smart contract.

## View Your NFTs in Metamask Wallet
1.	On the receiving end, the user can import the NFT token details into their Metamask wallet to view the assets. Please note that currently, Metamask Web Extension does not support the use of NFTs however, the mobile app version does support it. For the next steps to view the owned NFTs in your Metamask wallet, we will be using the Metamask Mobile Application.
2.	Open Keypair manager on the Black IDE and copy the private key of the keypair that you minted i.e., transfer NFT.
